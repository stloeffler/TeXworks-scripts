"TeXdoc" script for TeXworks

Description
===========

This script allows easy access to the texdoc tool.



Prerequisites
=============

- [TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/)



Installation
============

Simply put the script file into the "scripts" folder (or one of its subfolders).
You can find the "scripts" folder most easily by using the "Scripts > Scripting
TeXworks > Show Scripts Folder" menu item in TeXworks itself.
In addition, make sure that "Allow scripts to run system commands" is checked
under "Edit > Preferences... > Scripts". Moreover, the script assumes that the
"texdoc" program is in your PATH (if you don't know what that means you probably
don't need to take any action).
Afterwards, you need to click on "Scripts > Scripting TeXworks > Reload Script
List" or restart TeXworks.



Usage
=====

Click on the "Scripts > TeXdoc" menu item and enter the search term (e.g.,
package name) in the popup dialog.
